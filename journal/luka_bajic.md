* 28. (1h) Initial meeting at the company, familirazing ourselves with the problem and the requirements. 

## March 2025 (17h)

* 4. (5h) Scraped 6-digit NAICS codes from their website using BeautifulSoup library. Attempting to click on subpages using Selenium, without success - abandoning this approach. 
* 6. (1h) Setup AWS and BitBucket, studying sample_naics_classification data.
* 23. (10h) Created a script for random sampling from two datasets (PredictLeads' "ground truth" in FRI_data_naics_classification.jsonl and our scraped data from NAICS website in companies_all.json). Manually checked the correctness for cca. 200 companies (typically 1-2 codes each, sometimes up to 5) to obtain ground truth classification results.
  5. (1h) Came up with a conceptual idea for a framework for the purpose of evaluating various models and determined the best way for passing the data between different parts of the code.
