## February 2025 (1h)

* 28. (1h) Initial meeting at the company, familirazing ourselves with the problem and the requirements. 

## March 2025 (51h)

* 6. (8h) Preparation of all the enviromnents and research of the problem.
* 7. (10h) Scraping of all companies from naics website.
* 15. (10h) Scraping of all the codes from naics website and their top companies. 
* 28. (5h) Analysis of different LLM models. That includes their pricing, API structure, limits. (Gemini, ChatGPT).
* 29. (10h) Another scraping of data from Naics website. Now for complete descriptions and different informations for every NAICS code (Top companies, related codes, examples, description...)
* 30. (8h) Implementation of classification on Gemini model API.

## April 2025 (49h)

* 5. (15h) Implementation of framework using Luka's conceptual idea. This implementation includes robust loging functions, saving of models' outputs and calculation of necessary metrics.
* 6. (5h) Updates to Gemini model implementation so it works with framework.
* 10. (5h) Added additional metrics to framework (ratio of illegal codes, saving of illigal codes, multiple ground truths).
* 10. (3h) Implementation of Reevaluation model that enables re-evaluation of old outputs on new metrics.
* 14. (5h) Implementation of OpenAI model using their API, running some tests.
* 15. (8h) Updates to eval framework and test of Gemini and ChatGPT: Added ratio of illegal code per request (#ill_codes/#test_cases), Absolute accuracy (#matching_codes/#generated_codes), Removal of illegal codes before testing.
* 18. (8h) New version of Gemini and OpenAI models, analysis of illegal and mismatched codes in outputs of models.
## Total: [101h]
