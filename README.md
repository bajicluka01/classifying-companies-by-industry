## About this repository ##

A companyâ€™s industry classification is an important piece of information, for example, when searching for potential customers and competitors. One commonly used standard is the North American Industry Classification system (NAICS): https://www.naics.com/search/. Unfortunately, it is only available for a limited number of companies, so an efficient and effective way of categorizing the millions of other companies would be very beneficial.

The main goal of the project is to implement one or more approaches to assigning a NAICS code to a company, based on the structured and unstructured information provided on their website (page texts, jobs, news). The proposed approaches also have to be thoroughly evaluated, providing insights into parts of the classification hierarchy where they work well and parts where they fail. The students will be provided with a dataset of at least 30k company websites with industry labels.

Keywords: predictive machine learning, taxonomy/hierarchy classification, natural language processing
